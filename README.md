I'm a frontend junior with an insatiable appetite for learning. I'm armed with my freshly acquired front-end development education and ready to conquer the digital world!

You know that strangely satisfying feeling of immersing yourself in code? Well, I thrive on it. I can spend hours in a focused state, battling those pesky bugs and tweaking on every detail to make the code as neat as possible.


### Stuff I can do:
REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
